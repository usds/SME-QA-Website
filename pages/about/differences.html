title: How our process is different
intro: Applicants who receive a passing score after multiple professionally developed SME assessments are rated and placed on the certificate of eligibles (following current veterans' preference and category rating rules) by HR. While OPM encourages IO Psychologists to professionally develop assessments, this pilot will have SMEs, HR, and the Hiring Manager coming together to professionally develop the competencies, proficiency levels, and structured interview questions that will define the assessments. If the agency has available IO Psychologists, they should be encouraged to participate.

          <h4>Current process</h4>
          <p>
            Agencies use OPM's Qualification Standards to define the minimum qualifications for the job. Specialized Experience describes requirements needed for day one on the job. These are often described as tasks that someone needed to have experience doing, and tend to be very specific.
          </p>

        <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            The technical competencies that were identified and defined during job analysis will be listed in the job announcement under qualifications. This specialized experience becomes the minimum qualifications for the position that the SMEs will use to assess applicants throughout the process. The competencies do not need to be the same as in the OPM Qualification Standards if those were not identified as required during job analysis.

          <p>
            HR reviews resumes to determine if the applicants demonstrate the necessary qualifications and specialized experience. Applicants who pass this review are "minimally qualified".

        <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            Prior to sending the resumes to SMEs, HR reviews all applications to remove applicants are missing resumes and who are not US Citizens. For remaining applicants, SMEs review the resumes to determine if technical competencies warrant further assessments. HR ensures that the SMEs provided sufficient justification to retrace the decision without performing a separate minimum qualification check.

          <p>
            Applicants who remain eligible through the resume review/minimum qualification phase moves on to the assessment to determine quality category placement, most commonly using a self-rated occupational questionnaire.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="tablet:grid-col padding-y-2">
          <h4>Pilot process</h4>
          <p>
            Applicants who move forward past resume review enter into the structured interview assessments. Applicants first go through a shorter <strong>breadth</strong> interview with SMEs. If the SME determines that required proficiency levels are met, the applicant proceeds to a second <strong>depth</strong> interview. The breadth and depth assessment ratings are combined to create an <strong>overall passing score</strong> where passing requires the applicant to demonstrate that they meet the required proficiency levels (which then transmutes to a passing score of 70).
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicants who do not meet all the required proficiency levels in the initial breadth interview do not move forward and are screened out because they would be unable to achieve the <strong>required overall passing score of &gt;=70</strong>. Similarly, applicants who do not meet the required proficiency levels in the depth interview are screened out because of their inability to achieve an overall score of &gt;=70.
          </p>
          <p>
             Once SMEs return their transcripts to HR, HR will review the SME’s analysis and ratings for consistency and to ensure SMEs gave justification for not moving applicants forward that was based on the technical competencies.

          <p>
            HR adjudicates Veterans' Preference only for <strong>applicants who have achieved an overall passing score</strong>. HR then assigns applicants who achieved an overall passing score to a quality category using SME interview assessment scores. Prior to issuing the certificate, HR will ensure that the applicants listed on the certificate meet the salary level offered for the position.  HR then issues the certificate to the hiring manager for further interviews or to make immediate selections off the resumes and transcript notes.

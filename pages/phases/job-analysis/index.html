title: Job analysis workshop
intro: Conduct a two-day job analysis workshop with SMEs to professionally develop your assessments. You'll help SMEs and hiring manager(s) identify and define the required competencies and proficiency levels for the position, as well as write two sets of structured interview questions that can assess the required proficiency levels. SMEs will use these during interview assessments to determine whether applicants meet the technical qualifications for the job.
roles: [hr, sme, hiring-mgr, io-psych]
duration: 2.5 to 3 days (16 hours)
outputs:
  - Agreement on required duties in the position from day one
  - 4-6 core competencies and their definitions
  - Proficiency descriptions for each competency, including the proficiency required for the hiring action
  - First assessment questions and good sample responses
  - Second assessment questions and good sample responses
  - Job analysis worksheet (for hiring action case file)
  - SME decisions about resume review pages and tech recency requirements (see Assessment Strategy phase)

<h3>About Core Competencies and Proficiencies</h3>
<p>
  <em>Core competencies</em> are the professional skills an applicant must possess from their first day in the position you're hiring for, while <em>proficiencies</em> gauge how skilled an applicant is with the given competency depending on years of experience, the scale of the organizations they've worked in, or the complexity of the projects they've participated in.
</p>
<p>
  The job analysis workshop bridges what may be a standardized position description (PD) with the actual job your agency is hiring for. By defining your core competencies and proficiencies, your group will have a shared understanding of the core competencies and proficiencies an applicant needs to be successful in performing the duties for a given role. You'll also:
</p>
<ul class="usa-list">
  <li>Determine the assessment criteria and qualifications for your role(s).</li>
  <li>Develop structured interview questions.</li>
  <li>Decide how to accurately describe your role to applicants in your job announcement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Preparing Your Training Session</h3>

<p>Your job analysis workshop should be a total of 16 active hours, which typically spans 2.5 days with breaks. Send calendar invites to as many SMEs and hiring managers who will participate in your hiring action as possible.</p>
<ul class="usa-list">
  <li>Update the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/job-analysis/job-analysis-day-1-presentation.pptx">Day 1</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/job-analysis/job-analysis-day-2-presentation.pptx">Day 2</a> presentations with your agency-specific information.</li>

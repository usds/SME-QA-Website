intro: Ensure that each piece of information in your job announcement helps the job seeker to understand the work they'll do and how they'll be assessed. Review your job announcement before you publish it to ensure the best experience for applicants.

Use plain language throughout your announcement (it's the law!). For more information, see "[Plain Language](https://content-guide.18f.gov/plain-language/)" from the *18F Content Guide*.

- Mark any government-specific terms and either remove any that are unnecessary or explain those that must be mentioned.
- Use pronouns to personalize the content and experience. For example, use “you” and “your” when speaking to the job seeker, instead of terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.

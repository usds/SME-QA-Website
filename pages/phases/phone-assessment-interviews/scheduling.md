Before you [schedule training](training.md) for the first round of interviews, divide the SMEs into two groups based on which round of interviews they will conduct. Consider how many applicants passed resume review, as well as any scheduling conflicts you may be aware of at this time. Send SMEs calendar invites for the days or weeks they'll be conducting interviews as soon as possible.

Complete and share the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/toolkit/phone-assessment-interviews/interview-scheduling-instructions/">Scheduler Instructions</a> with the people who will schedule applicants. Keep these ideas in mind:

- **If there are multiple schedulers:** You'll need a shared scheduling email inbox where all emails between schedulers and applicants can be managed.
- **If second interviews will be scheduled as soon as applicants move forward from their first interview:** Alert schedulers with results of the first interview immediately so they can schedule the second interview. A cloud-based application like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365 can ease this coordination of scheduling tasks between schedulers.

        Agencies can drastically improve hiring outcomes using current delegated examining rules and regulations by incorporating Subject Matter Experts into the process.

        In spring 2019, the team tested the SME-QA process with two agencies, focusing on improving the quality of applicants appearing on certificates. Our <a href="https://smeqa.usds.gov/assets/SMEQA-initial-pilots-final-report.pdf">final report</a> and <a href="https://smeqa.usds.gov/assets/SMEQA-initial-pilots-case-study.pdf">case study</a> review the results and lessons learned.

        Later pilots sought to discover if the SME-QA process could flex to different assessment types and sped up through better tools to make resume reviews and interviews easier to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, the team refined the process with pilots at 15 agencies, including a government-wide pilot. Additional pilots are currently underway.

      The initial pilots focused on improving the quality of certificates, rather than reducing the time it takes an agency to hire applicants. However, to gather baseline information to inform future hiring actions that employ the SME-QA process, the team tracked time to hire data for the initial pilots.
    </p>
    <p>
      HHS was the first to pilot the SME-QA process, and took 3.5 months from posting the job announcement to creating the certificates. Learning quickly from HHS, the team iterated
      on the SME-QA process during the DOI pilot by concurrently scheduling and conducting the first and second interviews and simplifying assessment ratings to remove the less decisive “borderline” score. These rapid iterations helped DOI complete the same hiring phases as HHS in only two months. 
    </p>

  <div class="tablet-lg:grid-col-6">
    <p>
      USDS played the role of project manager, which kept the SME-QA process moving and reduced the time to hire. As project managers, the USDS team enforced the structure and completion of the job analysis workshop, which created both a shared understanding of the SME-QA process among all participants and also built the necessary momentum to post the job
      announcement one week later.

    <h3>Second round</h3>
    <p>
      The second round of pilots added a Resume Assessment Tool that allowed SMEs to conduct resume reviews, and for HR Specialists to audit those reviews, much faster than before. Also, written assessment reviews were used at CMS and EPA in lieu of a first round interview.
